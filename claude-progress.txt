**Server Restart Blocker:**

**Problem:** Backend server is running old code without MongoDB ObjectId fix

**Affected Features:**
- Feature #176: Todo completion checkbox
- Feature #177: Todo status tracking
- Feature #178: Todo snooze
- Feature #179: Todo deletion

**Root Cause:**
Running server uses: { _id: id } → matchedCount: 0
Fixed code uses: { _id: new ObjectId(id) }

**Resolution:**
1. Open Windows Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. End all node.exe processes
3. cd backend && node server.js
4. Run verification tests

**Estimated Time to Complete Blocked Features:** 10-15 minutes

**Next Session Priorities:**

1. **CRITICAL:** Restart backend server
2. Verify features #176-#179 after restart
3. Mark features as passing if verification succeeds
4. Expected progress: 152 → 156 features passing (46.2%)
5. Continue with next pending feature (#181+)

Progress: 152/338 features passing (45.0%)
