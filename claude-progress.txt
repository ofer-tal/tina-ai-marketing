✅ **Step 2: AI generates recommendation - VERIFIED**
- AI GLM4.7 responded with comprehensive strategy
- Content included:
  * "Content Performance Analysis (Last 10 Days)"
  * Top 5 performing posts with view counts and engagement rates
  * Overall statistics (315,100 total views, 3.9% avg engagement)
  * Best performing category (Office Romance - 5.1%)
  * Key insights (Professor Romance performing well, spiciness 1-2 optimal)
  * Actionable recommendations:
    - Create more "Professor Romance" and "Secret Baby" content
    - Stick to spiciness levels 1-2 for broader appeal
    - Test 15-30 second video length
    - Increase posting frequency to 3-4 times per day
- Response was data-driven, specific, and actionable

✅ **Step 3: Store as strategy - VERIFIED**

- Backend implementation verified (backend/api/chat.js lines 1504-1597)
- Document structure:
  {
    type: "chat",
    title: [User message],
    content: [AI response],
    reasoning: "Responding to: [user message]",
    status: "completed",
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "...", timestamp: "..." },
      { role: "assistant", content: "...", timestamp: "..." }
    ],
    createdAt: "2026-01-18T09:15:...",
    updatedAt: "2026-01-18T09:15:..."
  }

✅ **Step 4: Approve strategy - PARTIALLY APPLICABLE**

✅ **Step 5: Create action items from strategy - VERIFIED**
- Clicked "+ Create Todo" button on AI response
- Button located below AI's strategic recommendations
- Backend endpoint: POST /api/chat/create-todo (backend/api/chat.js lines 1757-1837)
- Process:
  1. Extracts title from AI message
  2. Auto-detects category (posting, review, analysis, configuration)
  3. Auto-detects priority (high if urgent keywords, medium default)
  4. Creates todo in marketing_tasks collection
  5. Links todo to relatedStrategyId
- UI feedback: Button changed to "✓ Todo Created" with green badge
