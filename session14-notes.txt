## Session Status: BLOCKED by environment issues

## Problem Encountered
1. Port conflicts on ports 3001, 3002 (in use by unknown processes)
2. Changed backend to port 3003 - backend running successfully
3. Frontend Vite server starts but doesn't serve content (connection timeout)
4. Cannot access http://localhost:5173 or any other Vite port
5. Browser automation times out trying to reach frontend

## Troubleshooting Attempted
- Killed old node processes (multiple attempts)
- Changed port from 3001 → 3002 → 3003
- Updated vite.config.ts proxy target to match backend port
- Restarted dev server multiple times
- Backend confirmed working (curl tests pass)
- Frontend unresponsive (curl hangs, browser timeout)

## Environment Details
- OS: Windows 11 with WSL2
- Node.js: v24.11.1
- Working directory: /c/Projects/blush-marketing
- Backend: Running on port 3003 ✅
- Frontend: Port 5173 (not responding) ❌
- MongoDB: Connected ✅

## Current Status
- Backend API: Operational (port 3003)
- Frontend: Not serving requests
- Feature #96: Marked in-progress but cannot test due to frontend issues

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Investigate Vite configuration issues
2. Check for Windows firewall blocking WSL ports
3. Consider running frontend directly in Windows PowerShell instead of WSL
4. Verify vite.config.ts has correct settings
5. Check if there are Node.js module conflicts
6. May need to clear node_modules and reinstall

## Files Modified This Session
- .env: PORT changed to 3003
- vite.config.ts: proxy target changed to http://localhost:3003

## Progress Unchanged
- Before: 90/338 features (26.6%)
- After: 90/338 features (26.6%)
- No new features completed due to blocking issues
