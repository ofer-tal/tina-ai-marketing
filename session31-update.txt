**REGRESSION TESTING RESULTS:**

✅ Feature #77 (View captions and hashtags) - PASSING
✅ Feature #42 (Content strategy suggestions) - PASSING
✅ Feature #40 (Budget change proposals) - PASSING

**CRITICAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED:**

**Issue:** Content Library modal not opening for Feature #77
- Root cause: handleVideoPreview function required videoPath to exist
- But posts in database don't always have videoPath set (it's optional)
- Result: Modal would never open, users couldn't see captions/hashtags

**Fix Applied:**
1. Modified handleVideoPreview to accept any post (removed videoPath check)
2. Added conditional rendering in modal to show placeholder when video/image missing
3. Added VideoPlaceholder styled component for better UX
4. File: frontend/src/pages/ContentLibrary.jsx

**Verification:**
- Clicked Play button on post → Modal opens ✅
- Caption displays: "Test caption for TikTok #romance #spicy" ✅
- Hashtags display as clickable tags: #romance, #spicy, #test ✅
- Formatting preserved across different posts ✅

**Git Commit:** b1457f8

**Progress:** 111/338 features (32.8%) - No change (regression testing only)

**All regression tests PASSED - ready to proceed with new features!**
