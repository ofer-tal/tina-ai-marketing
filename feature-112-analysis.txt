**Feature #112 Analysis: Error handling and retry for failed posts**

**Current State:**
- Error logging: ✅ Implemented (all errors logged with details)
- Failed status: ✅ Implemented (posts marked as 'failed' on error)
- Error storage: ✅ Implemented (error messages stored in database)
- Retry service: ✅ Exists but NOT integrated
- Exponential backoff: ✅ Available in retry service but NOT used
- Retry mechanism: ❌ NOT implemented in posting flow

**What's Working:**
1. All posting errors are logged with stack traces
2. Failed posts have status='failed' and error message stored
3. Upload progress tracking includes error states
4. RetryService class exists with full exponential backoff implementation

**What's Missing:**
1. TikTok posting methods don't use retry service
2. No automatic retry on transient failures (ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT, etc.)
3. No retry count tracking in database
4. No max retries enforcement
5. No manual alert when max retries reached

**Implementation Required:**
To complete this feature, need to:
1. Import retryService in posting services
2. Wrap API calls (init, upload, publish) with retry logic
3. Add retryCount field to MarketingPost schema
4. Implement max retries check before attempting retry
5. Add manual alert/notification when max retries reached
6. Update posting API endpoints to handle retry logic

**Files to Modify:**
- backend/services/tiktokPostingService.js (integrate retry)
- backend/services/instagramPostingService.js (integrate retry)
- backend/services/youtubePostingService.js (integrate retry)
- backend/models/MarketingPost.js (add retryCount, lastRetryAt)
- backend/api/tiktok.js (handle retry logic)
- backend/api/instagram.js (handle retry logic)
- backend/api/youtube.js (handle retry logic)

**Status:** Feature partially implemented (error handling works, but retry logic missing)
