MONGODB ISSUE - CRITICAL BLOCKER:

Issue: Mongoose queries timing out after 10000ms
Error: "Operation `marketingposts.find()` buffering timed out after 10000ms"

Status:
- MongoDB connection established ✅
- 25 posts exist in marketing_posts collection ✅
- Raw MongoDB queries work ✅
- Mongoose model queries timing out ❌

Impact:
- Cannot test features requiring database reads
- Features requiring writes blocked
- Content library shows empty despite data existing

Resolution Needed:
1. Add database indexes
2. Fix schema validation or make fields optional
3. Investigate Mongoose connection settings
4. Consider using raw MongoDB queries for simple operations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:

1. CRITICAL: Fix MongoDB timeout issue
2. Continue with UI-only features (avoid database operations)
3. Return to skipped features once MongoDB is fixed
4. Focus on already-implemented features that need marking
